# LEFT_Flamelight Biography  
### Hello everyone!

I am a 16-year-old middle school student from China.

I am withdrawn, timid and afraid of communication, but sincere and enthusiastic about people, although my emotions are not very stable, but I am still happy to make friends with everyone online!  
I'm interested in Java programs and MinecraftJavaMod, and I'm pretty good at it.  
I also do some simple art design, novel creation, planning, etc.

If there's anything I need help with, I'll try to help!

Thank you again for your support!
